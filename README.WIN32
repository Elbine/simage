You should be able to build the simage library if you have these
components installed on your system:

        * Cygwin[1], latest release

        * Microsoft Visual C++ v6.x


Configure and build the same way as you would on UNIX-based systems,
i.e.

        $ [srcdir]/configure --enable-dependency-tracking
        $ make install


(Notice the explicit activation of dependency tracking. Dependency
tracking is default added to the build process by configure only if it
can be done as a side effect by the compiler when actually
compiling. The cl.exe compiler of Microsoft Visual C++ has no public
way of getting dependencies without using the preprocessor.)

Note that if you encounter any problems when trying to build on
MSWindows, it is expected that you are able to do a minimum of
troubleshooting yourself before contacting us. If you are confident
that configure and/or build fails due to a mistake on our part, we
will be happy to assist.
