Todo
====

(format is: "* [author][conceived-date] item", listed in approx
prioritized order)

* [mortene][19990826] make it user-selectable whether or not to
  include support for the various image file formats (with everything
  defaulting to "include if available", of course)

* [mortene][19990826] have the build process put generated
  architecture specific files (object files etc) into their own
  subdirectory, which should somehow be named in an
  architecture-specific way. This will then make it possible to build
  for multiple platforms within the same source-copy.

* [mortene][19990826] most of the code in the .cpp files (and _all_ of
  the code in some of them) looks suspiciously "C-ish" -- and if the
  code is C, we should compile it as C, not C++.

* [mortene][19990822] fix version number problem (installs as 0.0.0,
  even though it's set as 0.9.0 in configure.in).

* [mortene][19990822] write information in these files: INSTALL, NEWS,
  README.

* [mortene][19990822] commit to SIM CVS new build system based upon
  autoconf.

* [mortene][19990822] use libgif/libungif to add support for GIFs.

* [mortene][19990822] use Qt, if present, to add support for a number
  of additional formats (XPM etc).

* [mortene][19990822] use imlib if available for the possibility of
  having a super slim libsimage -- or perhaps we should instead put in
  a test for imlib within the Coin library, at the same way as we'll
  do for simage (when the autoconf-based build is in place in Coin)?

* [mortene][19990826] exclude source files from build process when
  possible, based on HAVE_LIBJPEG, HAVE_LIBPNG and HAVE_LIBTIFF
  defines

Done
====

(format is: "* [author][conceived-date][finished-date][implementer] item")

* [mortene][19990822][19990826][mortene] check for the existence of
  the image import/export libraries which we depend upon, generate
  correct #ifdef statements in the code.

* [mortene][19990822][19990826][mortene] write information in these
  files: AUTHORS, COPYING (fetch the old file from CVS first),
  ChangeLog.
