Todo
====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in approx
prioritized order)

* [mortene:19990822] write simage-specific information in the INSTALL
  and README files.

* [mortene:19990822] use libgif/libungif to add support for GIFs.

* [mortene:19990822] use Qt, if present, to add support for a number
  of additional formats (XPM etc).

* [mortene:19990822] use imlib if available for the possibility of
  having a super slim libsimage -- or perhaps we should instead put in
  a test for imlib within the Coin library, at the same way as we'll
  do for simage (when the autoconf-based build is in place in Coin)?

* [mortene:19990901] make an example/test application

Done
====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date][implementer:finished-date] item")

* [mortene:19990826][mortene:19990908] have the build process put
  generated architecture specific files (object files etc) into their
  own subdirectory, which should somehow be named in an
  architecture-specific way. This will then make it possible to build
  for multiple platforms within the same source-copy. SOLUTION: this
  was not necessary to do, as autoconf handles the requested feature
  automatically if you move to another directory before running the
  configure script.

* [mortene:19990826][mortene:19990905] make it user-selectable whether
  or not to include support for the various image file formats (with
  everything defaulting to "include if available", of course)

* [mortene:19990905][mortene:19990905] default to only building the
  shared version of the library

* [mortene:19990826][mortene:19990905] exclude source files from build
  process when possible, based on HAVE_LIBJPEG, HAVE_LIBPNG and
  HAVE_LIBTIFF defines

* [mortene:19990822][mortene:19990905] fix version number problem
  (installs as 0.0.0, even though it's set as 0.9.0 in configure.in).

* [mortene:19990826][mortene:19990904] most of the code in the .cpp
  files (and _all_ of the code in some of them) looks suspiciously
  "C-ish" -- and if the code is C, we should compile it as C, not C++.

* [mortene:19990822][mortene:19990826] check for the existence of the
  image import/export libraries which we depend upon, generate correct
  #ifdef statements in the code.

* [mortene:19990822][mortene:19990826] write information in these
  files: AUTHORS, COPYING (fetch the old file from CVS first),
  ChangeLog.

* [mortene:19990822][mortene:19990822] commit to SIM CVS new build
  system based upon autoconf.
