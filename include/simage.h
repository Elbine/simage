/*
 * simage:
 *
 * A simple library for loading images. This library is designed
 * for loading textures to be used as OpenGL textures. 
 * Only pixel formats directly supported by OpenGL (v1.0) will be 
 * returned. The user is responsible for resizing the texture to
 * a 2^n width/height though.
 *
 * This library does not support the "new" OpenGL v1.1 image
 * formats. In the future this might be supported though. We still
 * have some old SGI HW with only OpenGL v1.0 installed...
 *
 * Usage information:
 *
 * simage_check_supported(filename): 
 *
 *   Will return 1 if filename can be loaded, 0 otherwise. 
 *
 * simage_read_image(filename, width, height, numComponents)
 *
 *   Will (attempt to) read filename, and return a pointer to
 *   the image data. NULL is returned if the image could not
 *   be loaded. The memory is allocated using malloc(), and
 *   it is the callers responsibility to free the memory (using free())
 *   width and height contains the width and height of the image,
 *   and numComponents is a number indicating the following:
 *     1 : Grayscale image (GL_LUMINANCE)
 *     2 : Grayscale with alpha channel (GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA)
 *     3 : RGB data (GL_RGB)
 *     4 : RGB data with alpha component (GL_RGBA)
 *
 *   Other image formats might be supported in the future. You
 *   should not assume 1 <= numComponents <= 4 :-)
 *
 * A couple of functions for your convenience:
 *
 * simage_resize(imagedata, width, height, numComponents,
 *               newwidth, newheight)
 *
 *   A convenience function you may use to resize an image for you.
 *   Since OpenGL textures must have width and height equal to 2^n,
 *   this is often needed. A pointer to the new image data is returned. 
 *   imagedata is not freed. BTW: If you need a high quality resize 
 *   function, don't use this one :-) 
 *
 * simage_next_power_of_two(int val)
 * 
 *   Will return the first 2^n bigger or equal to val. 
 *   If simage_next_power_of_two(size) != size, you'll typically
 *   need to resize your image to be able to use it in an OpenGL app.
