simage.spec.in

        Template processed by configure script to generate an RPM
        specification file simage.spec.

simage.iwz.in

        Template processed by configure script to generate
        specification file for InstallShield Express v2.12. Invoke the
        script by running

	       $ cd [simage_builddir]
               $ IsxBuild.exe build/simage.iwz -E -O

        A self-extracting executable SETUPEX.EXE with the
        InstallShield install should then be available under
        [simage_builddir]/build/simage/.

build_simage_win32.sh

        Builds simage for the Win32 platform in different
        configurations. All dependant libraries will be downloaded
        using wget.

        * Requires cygwin and wget. 
        * Run from the command line in any directory.

        This script is used by Systems In Motion when creating binary
        releases of simage, and is probably of little use to most
        simage users. If you want to configure and build simage yourself,
        please read the INSTALL file in the simage root directory for 
        instructions.
